# ireporter-challenge-one

## Project Description
Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must develop novel and 
localised solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of iReporter. iReporter enables 
any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the 
general public. Users can also report on things that needs government intervention.
